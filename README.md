## Introduction

This is my first web project, builded to learn the very basics of Web Development. The goal of this project is to make my first steps into the world of programation. My final goal is to become a Full Stack Developer üë©üèª‚Äçüíª, so this is only the begining of my journey!

## What I learned
As this is my first time writing code, I had to learn all the basics of HTML, CSS and JS.
I started learning HTML5 and building the structure of my site, then I continued with CSS. I leaned a lot about flexbox, grid, responsiveness, animations (the funniest part of CSS), and many other things. I enjoy writing CSS, and now even more since I started using Sass. I also tried Bootstrap. 
About JavaScript, I've just begun practising, that's why the site isn't very interactive yet. I used JS to make some animations trigger when the elements are scrolled to the window. Also, I've implemented some librarys to make the masonry layout for the gallery. I still have to make the form functionally, so if you want to contact Asgard, please use the links provided in the *Contact* section.
